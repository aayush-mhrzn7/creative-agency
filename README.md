# 👨‍💻 Aspiring Software Engineer

I'm a junior full-stack developer with a strong passion for creating functional and engaging digital experiences. With a foundation in the MERN stack, I enjoy building everything from dynamic frontend interfaces to efficient backend solutions. Currently, I’m working toward my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Technology at Kathford College in Kathmandu, Nepal. 🎓

I’m drawn to the creative and problem-solving side of coding, always excited to tackle new challenges and learn from each project. 🚀 My journey so far has been about combining my technical skills with a sense of curiosity, whether I'm debugging a tricky piece of code 🐛 or optimizing the user experience. 💡 I'm eager to continue growing as a developer and contribute meaningfully to projects that make a difference. 🌟
